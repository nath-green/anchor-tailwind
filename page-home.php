        <p class="mb-3">The only important thing is that you can be yourselves. And this, in my opinion, makes for the most genuine style of photography - natural and honest.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">A studio can be daunting, not just for the parents but for the baby too. Surely you can&apos;t have a more natural environment than your own home, right?</p>

  <p class="mb-3">What does that include?</p>
  <p class="mb-3">When you book you get the photoshoot session, which is normally a couple of hours and all your edited photos (usually between 20 and 40) in an online gallery to share, download, view and do as you please - they are yours to keep.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">If you do want some photos printing, I can help with that. But feel free to print them off for yourself, there are no obligations.</p>

  <h2>Photoshoot questions.</h2>
  <p class="mb-8">Frequently asked questions about in home photoshoots.</p>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What is the price and what is included?</h3>
    <p>I have one price of &pound;150.00. That includes an online gallery of all the selected images (normally between 20 and 40) where you can view, download and share. I believe in simple, all inclusive pricing with no hidden extras. Life is already complicated enough without being upsold or misled!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>Can you offer photos to be printed?</h3>
    <p>Of course! I am a strong believer that photos should be printed. If that is something you want, we can definitely arrange that - but feel free to organise your own printing if that suits you too, there are no obligations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>Where will the photoshoot take place?</h3>
    <p>The photoshoot will take place in the comfort of your own home. Take the stress out of trying to get to a studio with nappy sacks, travel cots and cuddly toys. You, your family and most importantly your baby will feel most comfortable in your own home.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What if my baby needs a nap or feeding?</h3>
    <p>This is best part about being in your own home. There are no time limits and the session is completely baby lead. Baby needs feeding? We stop for a feed. Baby needs a power nap? We sit down with a brew. Modeling can be hard work!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What areas do you cover?</h3>
    <p>I&apos;m based in Leeds but I am happy to travel, generally covering Yorkshire. There could be a small additional charge to cover travel costs but I will explain everything when I give you a quote.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What do I need for the home photoshoot?</h3>
    <p>Quite simply you don't need anything. Read more about <a href="/posts/how-to-prepare-for-an-in-home-photoshoot" class="text-purple-600 underline" title="Read a blog post about preparing for an in home photoshoot">how to prepare for an in home photoshoot</a>. I will bring everything I need which is generally just a camera and a standing light.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What is the best age for a photoshoot?</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">Every baby age and milestone is special in their own way. The photography style slightly changes with different ages but each stage is memorable.</p>
    <p>New parents worry about capturing the very early stages of a newborn, which is typically within the first 2 weeks - but sometimes that isn&apos;t doable. Newborns are still cute and squishy for some time after that.</p>
