  <h1>Natural in home newborn and baby photography in Leeds</h1>
  <p class="mb-3">Capturing a baby in their most comfortable surrounding makes for natural and authentic photographs.
    Studio shoots have their place, but I think can lead to to overly forced and unnatural poses. A happy photograph, is
    a happy baby. And a baby is happiest at home.</p>
  <p>My aim is to allow you to look back on the photographs without remembering that I was ever there, a real reminder
    of your baby at that time in their life.</p>

  <h2>Tell the story of your baby through natural yet beautiful photographs.</h2>
  <p class="mb-3">Being relaxed makes for genuine emotion and that is something I try to capture with a natural style of
    photography in your home. A studio can be daunting, not just for the parents for the baby too. You can't have a more
    natural environment than your own home.</p>
  <p>When people think photography, they often feel anxious about being posed or directed. That is not something I do. I
    let you and your baby lead the photographs - doing the things you would normally do throughout the day. You won't
    catch me telling you what to do, you know your baby best. I would only ever guide and think of ideas to make the
    photographs work in your home.</p>

  <h2>Telling your story with photographs at any age.</h2>
  <p>Whether your baby is a newborn, learning how to roll or sitting tall, there are no rules on when to capture stories
    of your baby. You should have the choice to decide, which is why I photography babies of all ages. Surrounded by
    their toys, nursery and other reminders will bring you back to this point in time, telling their story with a
    photographic series.</p>

  <h2>Photoshoot questions.</h2>
  <p class="mb-8">Frequently asked questions about the in home photoshoots.</p>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>Where will the photoshoot take place?</h3>
    <p>My photography style is natural and I think the best place for the photoshoot is where the baby feels most
      comfortable, generally this is at your own home but can be in a location that suits you most.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>Do you only cover the Leeds area?</h3>
    <p>Not just the Leeds area, no. I am happy to travel within a 30 minute radius of Leeds, generally covering West
      Yorkshire. But please feel free to contact if you are outside this and I am sure we can work something out.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What is the price of the photoshoot?</h3>
    <p>Â£250.00 for everything. I don't believe in charging per photo or a session fee which is why I charge just a flat
      fee for the photoshoot and you will receive all images digitally with no hidden charges.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What do I need for the home photoshoot?</h3>
    <p>Quite simply you don't need anything. I will bring everything I need which is generally just a camera and a
      standing light.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="c-box">
    <h3>What is the best time for a photoshoot?</h3>
    <p>There is no best time, every baby age and milestone is special in their own way. The photography style slightly
      changes with different ages but each stage is memorable. New parents worry about capturing the very early stages
      of a newborn, which is typically within the first 2 weeks.</p>
