  <h1>Newborn photoshoots</h1>
  <p class="mb-8">Newborn and baby photographer in Leeds, West Yorkshire.</p>
  <p class="mb-3">Photography is something that I have always had a passion for but it wasn't until I had my son, Sammy,
    that I wanted to pursue my hobby further. Naturally I started photographing the ever changing stages of Sam's life,
    capturing life's little details and printing them.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">I wanted to create memories for families that felt authentic and this meant crafting a style that
    would work best in the babies most natural environment, the family home. This gives a raw feeling to the photos and
    often includes hints of family life through parents, favourite toys, clothes and rooms of the house.</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I would highly recommend Nathan, he made us feel at
        ease from the moment he walked through our door. Having such a positive, easy going attitude which enabled us to
        get some fantastic photos of our little man. He's a natural with babies making our little man smile time after
        time!"</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I would really recommend Nathan for photographing your little one. He was so professional, patient and managed to capture our baby beautifully. I really love the idea of a photoshoot at home and I think we got much better pics than in a studio as Ben was so much more comfortable. Thanks so much Nathan! We are so happy to have such gorgeous photos!"</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I had the pleasure of meeting Nathan this morning and he captured some amazing pictures of my baby girl Ivy. So relaxed and in such a natural setting we didnâ€™t even have to leave to house. I would highly recommend Nathan if you want some special pictures of your little one. Such a talented and professional photographer."</p>
