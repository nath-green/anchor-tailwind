  <h1>About me, Nathan Green</h1>
  <p class="mb-8">Newborn and baby photographer in Leeds, West Yorkshire.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">By trade I&apos;m a website developer but I guess you don&apos;t need to know that. You don&apos;t need to know that my favourite NBA basketball team is the Denver Nuggets or that I eat copious amounts of Soreen either.</p>
  <p class="mb-3">Hopefully you like my style and photos, which is not the only thing that matters! You need to know how much I enjoy what I do, how easy going I am and how I know what you are going through with having a baby, it can be so difficult.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">I&apos;ve always had, what we call in Yorkshire, a &quot;proper&quot; camera. But learning newborn and baby photography is something hundreds of hours has been poured into. I know the struggle of juggling, metaphorically, a newborn and life in general.<p>

  <p class="mb-3">There is no greater feeling than seeing your work shared, loved and printed. And hopefully, my photos will soon be on your walls.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">Capturing those true special moments is about having somebody you can trust. When you book a photoshoot, my job is to make you feel relaxed and comfortable, but more importantly capture the heart of your family through your baby. It all starts with a cup of tea&hellip;</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I would highly recommend Nathan, he made us feel at ease from the moment he walked through our door. Having such a positive, easy going attitude which enabled us to get some fantastic photos of our little man. He's a natural with babies making our little man smile time after time!"</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I would really recommend Nathan for photographing your little one. He was so professional, patient and managed to capture our baby beautifully. I really love the idea of a photoshoot at home and I think we got much better pics than in a studio as Ben was so much more comfortable. Thanks so much Nathan! We are so happy to have such gorgeous photos!"</p>

      <p class="mb-2">"I had the pleasure of meeting Nathan this morning and he captured some amazing pictures of my baby girl Ivy. So relaxed and in such a natural setting we didnâ€™t even have to leave to house. I would highly recommend Nathan if you want some special pictures of your little one. Such a talented and professional photographer."</p>
